### Hi everyone, 👋 my name is Mariana 

I'm currently going to school for an associate degree in Analysis and Development of Systems. I've been learning to code for 2 years, since my college admission and after switching careers. I started with C language to learn programming logic, Data Structures and Java for concepts of Object Oriented Programming, making a few front-end projects between them, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript and some others back-end projects with Java, mySQL, JBDC, GIT and Spring MVC. However, I have found a passion for back-end development while studying Java and I'm looking forward to start my studies with Spring Framework.
